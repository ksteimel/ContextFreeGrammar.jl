This is a project for parsing context free grammars and feature grammars using julia

The goals of this project are the following: 
- Buila a method for ingestion of context free rules
- Build a method for ingestion of feature grammar rules
- Implement a context free parsing algorithm most likely the Earley parser to start with
- Implement unification 
- Use a modular architecture that allows for new parsing algorithms to be used and new rule intake methods
